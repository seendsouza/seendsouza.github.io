I was mainly deciding between software or radiology. They seemed to both be cool fields, so to figure out how one of them was like, I registered into my high school's co-op program.</p>\n<p>Luckily two of my friends recommended me to a telecommunications service assurance company with over 100 employees at the time. As someone with not a lot of programming experience, learning Python and passing the interview in two weeks while studying and writing exams was <em>quite</em> the experience.</p>\n<p>Before my term started, my supervisor, Jonathan Crone, drew and explained the general architecture of the product. Other than the skills and interest gained from working, that diagram was the most influential on my was the most influential on my development and growth. More on that later.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/3d91684a34164e02bd271458e1909cb3/6951b/work-station-straight-on-view.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"work station straight on view\"\n        title=\"work station straight on view\"\n        src=\"/static/3d91684a34164e02bd271458e1909cb3/d9c39/work-station-straight-on-view.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/3d91684a34164e02bd271458e1909cb3/20e5d/work-station-straight-on-view.jpg 450w,\n/static/3d91684a34164e02bd271458e1909cb3/8e1fc/work-station-straight-on-view.jpg 900w,\n/static/3d91684a34164e02bd271458e1909cb3/d9c39/work-station-straight-on-view.jpg 1800w,\n/static/3d91684a34164e02bd271458e1909cb3/6951b/work-station-straight-on-view.jpg 1950w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>When explaining the architecture, I had no clue what he was saying.
